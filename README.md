# Introduction

This repository provides the public multi-line patterns mentioned in our paper **"An Efficient Way to Parse Logs Automatically for Multiline Events"**.

For reasons of commercial confidentiality, we canâ€™t publish the code of our program. 
We just can provide the contents of the multi-line patterns for the three public datasets:

* Windows OS Logs
* OpenStack Logs
* HealthApp Logs

For the complete original contents of the above three datasets, please see https://github.com/logpai/loghub.
